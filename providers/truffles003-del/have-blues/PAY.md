HaveBlues is a pay-per-call gateway for AI agent services, built on top of the Hermes agent platform. Every call returns a real artifact (Python file + tests + README, scraped JSON, or cited markdown report) rather than a chatbot-style reply.

Three services are exposed:

* **Code Generator** (`POST /v1/code`) — generates production-ready Python 3.9 from a spec, including unittest tests and a README.
* **Web Scraper** (`POST /v1/scrape`) — fetches a public URL and returns structured JSON, with SSRF protection and rate limiting.
* **Research Reports** (`POST /v1/research`) — produces a markdown research report with cited sources from live web search.

All endpoints settle payments in USDC on Solana via the x402 protocol. No account or API key required — clients bring their own wallet and pay per call.

## Spend-aware usage

* Start with the cheapest endpoint (`/v1/scrape` at $0.03) to verify integration before using `/v1/research`.
* Pass a focused, complete spec to `/v1/code` (include sample input/output if possible) to avoid retries.
* For `/v1/research`, state the target word count and audience in the description; default is ~1500 words.
* Provide the target URL directly in the request body for `/v1/scrape` (not embedded in the description).
* Cap request rate client-side — there is no built-in burst limit beyond the public daily LLM spend cap on the provider side.

## Compatibility

Any x402-compatible client can call this service. Reference implementation:

    pay curl -X POST https://haveblues.pay.sh/v1/code \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"title": "CSV deduplicator", "description": "Python script that reads a CSV by email column, removes case-insensitive duplicates, writes to output.csv. Stdlib only."}'

The `pay` CLI auto-handles the 402 challenge, signs the payment, retries the request, and returns the response.

## Pricing

| Endpoint | Price per call |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/code` | $0.05 USDC |
| `POST /v1/scrape` | $0.03 USDC |
| `POST /v1/research` | $0.15 USDC |
| `GET /health` | free |

## Limits

* SSRF protection: only public HTTP/HTTPS targets accepted; private IP ranges (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16) and `file://`/`ftp://`/`javascript:` are refused.
* Daily LLM spend is capped on the provider side; calls beyond the cap return `429 Payment Required` until the next UTC day.
* Sub-skill workspaces (generated files) live on the provider's machine; copies are returned in the JSON response.

## Security notes

This catalog entry does not include wallet addresses, signer paths, or internal file paths. Operator wallet details are configured server-side and never exposed via the public endpoint. Clients should treat the service as untrusted for input validation purposes (the provider validates inputs but agents should still sanitize).
