Unified crypto market data gateway aggregating four data sources: CoinGecko for market prices and on-chain DEX pool data, DefiLlama for DeFi protocol analytics and TVL tracking, Alchemy for Ethereum token balances and transaction simulation, and Etherscan for on-chain account and contract data. All endpoints are POST and priced at $0.01 per request.

## Spend-aware usage

- Pick the source before paying: CoinGecko for prices, markets, trending, and
  token/pool metadata; DefiLlama for TVL, yields, bridges, fees, treasuries, and
  stablecoin supply; Alchemy or Etherscan for Ethereum account, transaction,
  contract, gas, and log data.
- Use batch-capable endpoints for multiple coins, addresses, or IDs instead of
  one request per item.
- Skip discovery calls when the user gives canonical IDs, contract addresses, or
  chain names. Use search/discovery only when identifiers are genuinely missing.
- For historical charts, request the smallest date range and granularity that
  answers the question.
