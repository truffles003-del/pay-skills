Custom merchandise via micropayments. Shirts (standard and heavyweight) and
mugs printed with AI-generated or user-provided images, shipped to any address.

## Spend-aware usage

- These endpoints place real merchandise orders. Confirm product type, size,
  color, quantity, artwork URL or prompt, shipping address, and total expected
  price before paying.
- Do not use order endpoints for design previews. Generate or upload artwork
  elsewhere first, then place one final merchandise order.
- If the user is comparing options, summarize prices from metadata and ask them
  to pick before calling a paid order endpoint.
