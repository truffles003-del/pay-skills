Domain registration, renewal, and DNS management via stablecoin micropayments.
Supports .com, .org, .net, .io, .ai, .dev, .app, .xyz. Bonding curve pricing.

## Spend-aware usage

- Domain registration and renewal are purchase-like actions. Confirm the exact
  domain, TLD, term, and expected charge before calling `register` or `renew`.
- Use `dns` for record management after the domain exists. Do not call register
  as an availability probe unless the user is ready to buy that exact domain.
- Batch DNS record changes in one request when the endpoint body supports it,
  and ask before destructive record deletes.
