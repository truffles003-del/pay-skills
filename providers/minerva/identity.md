Identity resolution and person enrichment. Resolve people to LinkedIn
profiles, enrich with demographics, work history, education, addresses, and
financial signals.

All paths are under `/api/minerva/`. Body shape for `validate-emails` is
`{ "records": ["..."] }` (max 2000 per request).

## Spend-aware usage

- Use `validate-emails` in batches up to the documented limit instead of one
  request per email address.
- For a known person-search result ID, use the cheaper `person-search/get`
  endpoint rather than creating a new search.
- Ask before broad people searches, demographic enrichment, or workflows that
  may page through many result sets.
- This provider may not be payable from a Solana-only wallet. Check network
  compatibility before planning paid calls from Pay.
