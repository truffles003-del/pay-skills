## Spend-aware usage

- Prefer `v2/documents:annotateText` when the user needs multiple analyses
  such as sentiment plus entities plus classification. One combined call is
  cheaper than separate analysis calls.
- Send only the text needed for the decision. Trim boilerplate, quoted replies,
  and unrelated document sections before paying.
- Provide language and encoding hints when known to avoid follow-up calls caused
  by ambiguous input.
