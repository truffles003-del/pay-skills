## Spend-aware usage

- Use `v1/text:synthesize` directly when the user supplies text and does not
  need voice discovery. Call voice-list endpoints only when selecting a voice.
- Generate the final text once. Ask before producing multiple voices, languages,
  or formats.
- Prefer compact audio encodings when quality requirements allow, and split long
  narration only when the API size limits require it.
