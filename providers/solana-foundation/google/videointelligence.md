## Spend-aware usage

- Use video annotation only for the specific features requested, such as labels,
  shots, OCR, speech transcription, explicit content, or object tracking. Do not
  request every feature by default.
- Ask before analyzing long videos or multiple files, because cost scales with
  media duration and selected features.
- Keep and poll the returned operation name. Do not submit the same video again
  while the operation is pending.
