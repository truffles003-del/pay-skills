## Spend-aware usage

- Use `translateText` when source and target languages are known. Use
  `detectLanguage` only when the source language is unknown.
- Batch multiple short strings in one request when they share the same language
  pair.
- Use romanization, adaptive translation, glossaries, datasets, or custom models
  only when the user asks for those advanced features. They are not needed for
  ordinary translation.
