## Spend-aware usage

- Use one `v1/entities:search` call with the most specific name and type hint
  available. Set a small limit for disambiguation tasks.
- This provider resolves entities; it is not a live web search engine. Use web
  search or Sonar when the user asks for current events or citations.
- If the user already supplied a canonical URL or ID, do not call Knowledge Graph
  unless they need entity metadata or disambiguation.
