## Spend-aware usage

- Use synchronous `v1/speech:recognize` for short audio and
  `v1/speech:longrunningrecognize` for longer audio or Cloud Storage inputs.
- Provide encoding, sample rate, language code, and channel count when known to
  avoid failed paid attempts.
- Transcribe the smallest useful audio segment. Ask before transcribing long
  files, multiple files, or repeated language/model variants.
- Poll long-running operations returned by the API. Do not resubmit audio while
  an operation is pending.
