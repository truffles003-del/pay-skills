## Spend-aware usage

- Use `v1/images:annotate` for image OCR, labels, safe-search, faces, logos, or
  landmarks. Include only the requested feature types; do not request the full
  Vision feature set by default.
- Batch multiple images in one annotate call when the request size allows.
- Use file endpoints for PDF/TIFF OCR and async endpoints only for large batches
  or multi-page documents that require long-running processing.
- Do not fetch product-search catalog resources unless the task is explicitly
  about managing or searching a product catalog.
