## Spend-aware usage

- Use document processing endpoints only when an existing processor is known or
  the provider instructions returned a ready processor path. Creating processors,
  schemas, or schema versions is setup work and should be confirmed separately.
- For one document, use the synchronous process endpoint when available. Use
  batch or long-running operations only for multiple documents or large files.
- Request only the needed extraction fields or processor type. Do not create a
  custom schema just to parse a one-off document.
- Poll operation IDs returned by async calls. Do not resubmit the same document
  because an operation is still running.
