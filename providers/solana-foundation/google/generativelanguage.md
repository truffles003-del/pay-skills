## Spend-aware usage

- Use `generateContent` for a one-shot Gemini answer and `streamGenerateContent`
  only when streaming is useful to the caller.
- Use `countTokens` before paying for generation only when the prompt is large
  or the user gave a strict budget. Do not count tokens for short prompts.
- Use batch embedding endpoints for multiple texts. Do not call single embedding
  repeatedly when a batch endpoint fits.
- Corpus, file, and permission endpoints are setup/state management. Ask before
  creating persistent retrieval resources.
