## Spend-aware usage

- Use `v1:validateAddress` once with the most complete address the user can
  provide, including region code and postal code when known.
- Do not call this provider for generic geocoding or place search; use Places
  when the task is finding a venue or coordinates rather than validating a
  deliverable postal address.
- Call `v1:provideValidationFeedback` only after the user or workflow has chosen
  a final validated address. It is not needed for one-shot validation answers.
