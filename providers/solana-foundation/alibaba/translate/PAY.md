## Spend-aware usage

- Set source and target languages explicitly when known instead of spending extra requests on avoidable detection or retries.
- Batch related text into one request when the upstream format allows it instead of paying for many tiny translation calls.
- Prefer one well-formed request with the right model options over several trial-and-error calls, especially when the body selects the model behavior.
