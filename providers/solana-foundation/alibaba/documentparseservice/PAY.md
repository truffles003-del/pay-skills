## Spend-aware usage

- Choose the endpoint that best matches the document or image type before paying; do not shotgun several recognizers against the same asset by default.
- Send the cleanest public image or document input you have and request only the structured output format the caller actually needs.
- This provider exposes only the allowlisted stateless synchronous subset from the paired gateway manifest. Do not assume async jobs or stateful resource-management APIs are available unless the spec shows them explicitly.
