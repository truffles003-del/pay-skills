## Spend-aware usage

- Choose the exact moderation, verification, or risk endpoint that matches the user’s task instead of trying several similar flows on the same payload.
- Send only the minimum sensitive text, image, biometric, or identity data needed for the requested check.
- This provider exposes only the allowlisted stateless synchronous subset from the paired gateway manifest. Do not assume async jobs or stateful resource-management APIs are available unless the spec shows them explicitly.
