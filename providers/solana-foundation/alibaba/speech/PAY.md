## Spend-aware usage

- Submit one transcription job and poll the returned task ID instead of resubmitting the same audio while a task is still running.
- Use public audio URLs and keep clips focused when only one segment or excerpt is needed.
- Poll the task-status endpoint with the returned task ID and wait for completion instead of creating duplicate transcription tasks.
