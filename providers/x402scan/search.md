Indexed registry and payment data explorer for the x402 protocol. Query
resources, merchants, wallets, facilitators, or full-text-search the catalog.

Most data endpoints are GET and cost $0.01–$0.02 per call. The registry write
endpoints (`register`, `register-origin`) use SIWX wallet auth and are free.
The `send` endpoint forwards USDC to a recipient — the paid amount equals the
transfer plus a small protocol fee.

Note: x402scan redirects bare-domain requests to `www.x402scan.com`. Follow
redirects in your HTTP client.

> **Network compatibility:** the live 402 challenge currently accepts Base USDC
> only — Solana payment was not in the accepted list at audit time. Confirm
> with `pay skills probe` before publishing.

## Spend-aware usage

- Use `api/x402/resources/search` for keyword discovery and
  `api/x402/resources` for browsing or pagination. Do not call both unless the
  first result set is insufficient.
- Use merchant and wallet transaction endpoints only when the address is known.
  Otherwise search resources or merchants first with a narrow query.
- Registry write endpoints use SIWX. Confirm the origin/resource URL before
  registering, and do not register third-party origins speculatively.
- `api/x402/send` moves USDC. Treat it as a transfer: confirm recipient, chain,
  amount, and fee before paying.
