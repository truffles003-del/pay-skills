2Captcha CAPTCHA-solving endpoints exposed through PaySponge with x402
payments.

The published OpenAPI document advertises task creation, result polling, and
correct or incorrect solve reporting for reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCaptcha, Cloudflare
Turnstile, FunCaptcha, GeeTest, image captchas, and related challenge types.

## Spend-aware usage

- Use `POST /createTask` only once per challenge, then reuse the returned task
  id when polling instead of creating duplicate solve jobs.
- Call `POST /getTaskResult`, `POST /reportCorrect`, and
  `POST /reportIncorrect` only after you have a task id and downstream outcome
  from the earlier task-creation flow.
