Agentic email service. Create inboxes, send and receive email for AI agents.
Each inbox gets a unique address that can send and receive messages immediately.

## Spend-aware usage

- Use `inbox/messages` directly when the user already has an inbox identifier or
  address. Do not create a new inbox just to check existing mail.
- Create an inbox once, then reuse it for send and receive workflows. Ask before
  creating multiple inboxes or long-running polling loops.
- For "check my mail" style requests, make one message-list call first and only
  fetch or summarize individual messages if the returned list is not enough.
