Pay-per-use communication APIs for AI agents. WebRTC for real-time voice,
plus speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Decentralized infrastructure
with low-latency global coverage.

## Spend-aware usage

- Use `stt` for one-shot transcription and `tts` for one-shot speech synthesis.
  Use `webrtc` only when the user wants an interactive live voice session.
- Before starting WebRTC, confirm the conversation goal, expected duration, and
  whether the user is ready to join. Do not open realtime sessions speculatively.
- For TTS, send the final text once instead of generating several voice variants
  unless the user explicitly asks to compare voices.
